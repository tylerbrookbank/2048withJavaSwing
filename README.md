# 2048withJavaSwing
2048 game made in Java Swing

*2048*

Welcome to 2048! 
Try to create a 2048 block.
In order to do this you need to slide like blocks into one another. Example a 2 block and a 2 block with combine to make a 4 block.
An 8 block and an 8 block with combine to make a 16 block.

Once the game starts use the arrow keys to slide the blocks left, right, up and down. Each move will slide all blocks in that direction. If a move is not valid, no blocks can slide that way, nothing will happen. All valid moves will spawn a new block, either a 2 or 4 block.

Good Luck!
